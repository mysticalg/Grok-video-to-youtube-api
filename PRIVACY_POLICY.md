# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2026-02-15

This Privacy Policy explains how this project handles data when you use this repository and Software.

## 1. Scope
This policy applies to the code and documentation in this repository. It does not replace the privacy policies of third-party services (for example xAI, OpenAI, YouTube, Meta/Facebook/Instagram, GitHub).

## 2. Data the Software May Process
Depending on how you use the Software, it may process:
- API keys, OAuth tokens, and service credentials you provide.
- Prompts and metadata you enter.
- Generated media files, local video/audio files, and stitched outputs.
- Basic runtime logs shown in-app or written locally.

## 3. Where Data Is Stored
By default, this project primarily stores data locally on your machine (for example, downloaded media and local preference files). If you use integrated third-party APIs, relevant data is transmitted to those services under your configuration.

## 4. How Data Is Used
Data is used only to provide requested functionality, such as:
- Generating video prompts/content.
- Stitching, enhancing, and processing local media.
- Uploading media to user-selected third-party platforms.

## 5. Data Sharing
Project maintainers do not operate a hosted backend for this repository. Data sharing generally occurs only when you choose to send data to third-party APIs/services through the app.

## 6. Security
Reasonable efforts are made in the codebase to support secure handling patterns, but no method is perfectly secure. You are responsible for:
- Protecting your local device.
- Keeping credentials private.
- Rotating/revoking tokens if compromised.

## 7. Retention and Deletion
You control your local files and can remove them at any time. Third-party services retain data according to their own policies.

## 8. Children’s Privacy
This project is not directed to children under 13 (or equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction).

## 9. Policy Updates
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

## 10. Contact
For privacy questions related to this repository, open an issue on GitHub.
